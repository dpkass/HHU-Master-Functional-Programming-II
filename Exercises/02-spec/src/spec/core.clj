(comment "Task 2: (Specs II)")

(comment "In exercise 9.2, a test.check generator was used to generate users with identifiers.

Write a spec for a user. A user is represented by a map containing their first- and last name and
an identifier. The identifier consists of the first two characters of the first name, the first
three characters of the last name, and three digits.

An example of a valid user is
  {:first-name \"John\", :last-name \"Wayne\", :id \"joway142\"}.

Some invalid values are:
 42
 {:first-name \"John\", :last-name \"Wayne\", :id \"cowboystud69\"} ; incorrect identifier
 {:first-name \"John\", :surname \"Wayne\", :id \"joway142\"} ; surname is invalid")
